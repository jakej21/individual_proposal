    "### Analysis 1: **Average Usage Comparison by Age Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question**: How does usage frequency of the service vary across different age groups?\n",
    "  - *Connection to Prompt*: By understanding how different age groups engage with the service, the project can pinpoint where engagement may be lacking and strategize accordingly. This can directly aid in tailoring community engagement strategies to various demographic segments.\n",
    "- **Variables**:\n",
    "  - `Usage Frequency` (numeric) and `Age` (categorical, grouped by ranges).\n",
    "  - *Visualization*: A bar chart comparing average usage frequency across age groups will highlight any differences in engagement.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Visualizing these differences allows quick identification of age groups with higher or lower engagement.\n",
    "- **Analysis Method**:\n",
    "  - *Method*: Group the dataset by age range and calculate the average usage for each group. Conduct a one-way ANOVA test (if data distribution assumptions are met) to see if the observed differences in means are statistically significant.\n",
    "  - *Assumptions Addressed*: Usage frequency data should ideally be normally distributed within each age group. If assumptions aren’t met, a non-parametric test (e.g., Kruskal-Wallis) could be used.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "  - Younger users might display higher engagement levels, while older users may show a decline.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis/Results Discussion**:\n",
    "  - *Hypothesis*: There is a statistically significant difference in usage frequency across age groups.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Identifying groups with lower usage can inform targeted outreach, potentially improving overall user engagement.\n",

    "### Analysis 2: **Satisfaction Level by Gender**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question**: Are there gender-based differences in satisfaction levels with the service?\n",
    "  - *Connection to Prompt*: Understanding gender differences in satisfaction may point to areas where the service needs improvement or adjustment.\n",
    "- **Variables**:\n",
    "  - `Satisfaction Score` (numeric) and `Gender` (categorical).\n",
    "  - *Visualization*: A bar chart comparing satisfaction scores between genders will clarify potential disparities.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: This can help in evaluating if specific features or services are aligned with different user needs based on gender.\n",
    "- **Analysis Method**:\n",
    "  - *Method*: Use an independent samples t-test (if assumptions are met) to compare mean satisfaction scores by gender.\n",
    "  - *Assumptions Addressed*: Satisfaction scores should ideally be normally distributed for each gender group, and variances should be equal. A Mann-Whitney U test can be applied if assumptions are not met.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "  - Satisfaction scores may reveal gender-based variations that highlight differing user expectations.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis/Results Discussion**:\n",
    "  - *Hypothesis*: There is a statistically significant difference in satisfaction levels between genders.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: By understanding if one gender has notably lower satisfaction, the project can suggest targeted improvements to address this disparity.\n",

    "### Analysis 3: **Most Common Reason for Using the Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question**: What is the most common reason users engage with the service?\n",
    "  - *Connection to Prompt*: Knowing the primary motivators behind service usage can help prioritize service features that matter most to users.\n",
    "- **Variables**:\n",
    "  - `Reason for Use` (categorical).\n",
    "  - *Visualization*: A bar chart will depict the frequency of each reason for using the service, clearly showing the most common motivators.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: This visualization will allow easy identification of top motivators, guiding future content or service updates.\n",
    "- **Analysis Method**:\n",
    "  - *Method*: Perform a simple frequency count of each category within `Reason for Use`.\n",
    "  - *Assumptions Addressed*: Assumes that reasons for use are well-represented and meaningful as categorical labels.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "  - A dominant reason, such as “convenience,” could emerge as a primary motivator.\n",
    "- **Hypothesis/Results Discussion**:\n",
    "  - *Hypothesis*: Certain reasons for use (e.g., convenience, necessity) will have significantly higher counts than others.\n",
    "  - *Relevance*: Insights into user motivations can inform resource allocation to support the most desired aspects of the service.\n",
