    "### Analysis 1: **Average Usage Comparison by Age Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables to Explore**: `Usage Frequency` and `Age`\n",
    "- **What This Analysis Will Do**:\n",
    "   - This analysis will calculate the average usage frequency for different age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.).\n",
    "   - A bar chart will be used to display the average usage for each age group, making it easy to see differences at a glance.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "   - The results may show that younger age groups have a higher average usage frequency than older groups.\n",
    "- **Relevance to Project**:\n",
    "   - Knowing which age groups use the service more frequently could help in targeting resources or communications to those groups effectively.\n",

    "### Analysis 2: **Satisfaction Level by Gender**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables to Explore**: `Satisfaction Score` and `Gender`\n",
    "- **What This Analysis Will Do**:\n",
    "   - This analysis will calculate the average satisfaction score for each gender, providing insight into satisfaction differences.\n",
    "   - The results will be displayed in a simple bar chart, showing how satisfaction varies between genders.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "   - The analysis may reveal that one gender has a higher average satisfaction score, which could indicate differing needs or expectations.\n",
    "- **Relevance to Project**:\n",
    "   - Understanding gender-based satisfaction differences can guide improvements in areas where satisfaction is lower, helping to enhance overall user experience.\n",

    "### Analysis 3: **Most Common Reason for Using the Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables to Explore**: `Reason for Use`\n",
    "- **What This Analysis Will Do**:\n",
    "   - This analysis will count the frequency of each reason for using the service, identifying the most popular reason among participants.\n",
    "   - A bar chart will display each reasonâ€™s count, showing the most common motivation for use.\n",
    "- **Expected Outcome**:\n",
    "   - This analysis might show that a specific reason, such as convenience or necessity, is the primary driver for using the service.\n",
    "- **Relevance to Project**:\n",
    "   - Knowing the main reasons for use can help prioritize features or services that align with user motivations, improving relevance and satisfaction.\n",
